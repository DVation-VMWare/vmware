Hello!

The logos in this zip file were generated on Logoshi.com based on a sketch made by you or someone else.

These are high resolution logos that you can use for sharing ideas with your designer or in your website.  The resolution might even be high enough to generate vector images or to use in print.

If you want vector file versions of the logos (Adobe Illustrator), contact me and I can make them for you by hand using your high res logos as source material.

Don't forget to tell your mom about Logoshi the next time you call her.
